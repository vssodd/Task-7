# Task-7

Summary Overview of All Code Files
The collection consists of nine Python scripts focused on a variety of fundamental programming tasks, primarily centered on numerical computations, user interaction, and control flow logic. The tasks include:

Mathematical computations and series: Calculating sums of series, averages of numbers divisible by a certain value, and evaluating polynomial functions over ranges.

Resource tracking and budgeting: Monitoring expenses against fixed incomes (e.g., scholarships) over time with adjustments for growth.

Countdown timers with user interruption: Implementing interactive countdowns that can be paused or stopped by user input.

Sequencing and arrangement problems: Generating balanced arrangements of two groups (boys and girls) under constraints to avoid dominance by one group.

Iterative looping and conditional checks: Using loops with dynamic step sizes, validating inputs, and printing intermediate results to the console.

Each script demonstrates essential programming concepts such as input validation, loops, conditionals, arithmetic operations, and string manipulations. Together, they form a solid foundation for practicing basic algorithm design and problem-solving skills in Python.
